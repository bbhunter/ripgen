# ripgen
A rust-based version of the popular [dnsgen](https://github.com/ProjectAnte/dnsgen) python utility.

`ripgen` is split into two main parts:

* **ripgen**: _A CLI utility that calls into `ripgen_lib` and uses dnsgen's transforms_.
* **ripgen_lib**: _A library that allows you to create high performance permutations of domain names._

# How to Install!
Installation of `ripgen` is very simple - follow the steps below.

### Step 1 - rustup.rs
Visit https://rustup.rs/ and follow the instructions to get started with `rust` and `cargo`.

### Step 2 - cargo install
Run `cargo install ripgen`

## How to Use - `ripgen`
`ripgen` optionally takes a domain file, a wordlist file, and a minimum word length argument.

If no domain file is listed, domains are expected through `stdin` making it easy to pipe into from other tools.

e.g.
```
$ echo "www1.google.com" | ripgen
```

One deviation from dnsgen's behavior is that if no wordlist is specified then no wordlist items are included automatically. To compare `ripgen` and `dnsgen` appropriately you should make sure to specify a wordlist.

## How to use - `ripgen_lib`
`ripgen_lib` exposes a `RipGenManager` struct that takes in three components:

* an iterator for domain names
* an iterator for wordlist entries
* a function that converts `&&str` into `bool` for the purposes of filtering wordlist entries

After creating a `RipGenManager`, transforms can be added on with `transform` and `chain_transform`. These transforms require a function definition (closure or otherwise) be passed in that can take the `&DomainComponent` and `WordListIterator` types and return an `Iterator<Item = String>`.

Look at the non-default dnsgen transform implementations for examples on how these are implemented typically.

# FAQ
## `linker 'cc' not found`
If this happens, it means that you need to install some dependencies on your system to build `ripgen`. Here's how to fix that:


### Debian (Ubuntu, Kali, WSL (_you probably used Ubuntu_))
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Arch
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

### Centos
```
sudo yum install gcc
```

### Alpine
```
apk add build-base --no-cache
```
